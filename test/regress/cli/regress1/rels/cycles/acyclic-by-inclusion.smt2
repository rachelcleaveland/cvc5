; Every edge of (rel.join (rel.iden A) po) is an edge of po, so a cycle of it
; would be a cycle of po, which is asserted acyclic. The contradiction only
; appears when the cycle witness closes, so unrolling the witness edge by edge
; never terminates: each unrolled edge is shown to be a po edge, but the cycle
; can always be assumed longer. The anchoring rule derives the contradiction
; directly from the two acyclicity constraints (the cyclic relation is
; syntactically included in the closure of the acyclic one).
