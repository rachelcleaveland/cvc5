; Litmus-template completeness query for sequential consistency with one
; thread (sc-1-th of rachelcleaveland/relational-solver-benchmarks): is there
; an execution with a cycle in rf U po U co U fr that none of the coherence
; templates ((po+ inter same-address) ; rf/co/fr irreflexive) catches? With one
; thread program order is total, so every com edge of such a cycle is either
; backward in po+ (caught by a template) or forward, and then the whole cycle
; lies in po+, which is acyclic. The cycle witness of the negated acyclicity
; has no a-priori length bound; with --rels-acyclic-backward-chords the
; minimality rule forbids closure edges in both directions between
; non-adjacent witness elements, so the totality axiom bounds the witness to
; three elements. Without the option this query does not terminate within
; minutes under --inst-when=full. The unsat-core check is disabled because the
; core is re-checked without these options.
